## Drag example

Demo of useful features for using Windy plugins on a mobile device,  but most importantly:

 1. How to use the left pane on mobile,  and also how to make a partial left pane,  with the picker and calendar still exposed.  The pane resizes as the calendar expands.
 2. Added a handle to the top of the mobile pane to resize it.
 3. How to add touch drag gestures on mobile.
